  the many calls to: gl.uniform3fv( program.unifLoc.pos,   [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] );
  
  br.col, br.pos?, .....
  
  activate br.changed for all buffers
  
  function vertexWPos3( wPos, numObjects-. null )
  
ToDo
  Reverse all loops (ex. --i)
  All loops ++i NOT i++

  Make texture creating and loading robust 
    When creating the font texture we want texWidth and height in the glTexture object(for use)
    OR connect the font texture(with an array index??) with the glTexture object


In meshes that consist of an array of meshes, like balls and bricks etc,
it is best to implement an 'all active' array to hold the indexees of the
active meshes, insted of looping through all meshes and checking if(mesh.isActive)
OR having to sort the array by active meshes.

Implement the Rect class as extension to everyy class  that has a rect mesh

Remove all unecessary functions like: BallGetDim() etc
