typed Arrays methods : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array

change powUp.type from string to contant number

change all arrays [] to new32FloatArrays or uints

try to make one for loop for drawing everything in render

try to create rectangles with general call to createRect

use return in all if 's (like collisions, for unnecessary for loops)

Display realFps with call to date.now()(instead of for loop)

create unsignedInt or bool type

brake the createData function into seperate for each  type

//if( powUps[i].pos[1] < player[ plIndex ].pos[1] +1 )

make the .split for texts inside CalculateTextDimentions so it finds
all characters

Make:	bricksCollumsIndexArr	//for collisions
Make:	bricksRowsIndexArr		//for collisions
Make:	bricksPowUpsIndexArr 	//for different texturing






/// STAGES

// Bonus Stages

Rush stages

May have some stages as bonus for extra points
	the player have to hit a moving target ( or more )
